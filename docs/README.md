Welcome to the documentation of search-a-licious,
a ready to use search component built on top of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).

## Executive summary

Search-a-licious transforms large data collections into searchable content, allowing users to quickly find what they need with powerful queries, facet exploration, and visualizations. Originally developed for Open Food Facts, itâ€™s perfect for exposing data, supporting decision-making, and enabling exploration, unlocking the full potential of open data collections. Developers can rapidly build apps thanks to its easy configuration, reusable components, and robust architecture.

## What is search-a-licious ?

We created this project in order to leverage collections of (uniform enough) data
to build tools that can:
* make this data reachable by a large public
* help users find the right items according to their criteria
* enable data exploration and get useful insights

It provides a ready to use component to:
* provide an engaging search experience with
  * a fast full text search
  * facets to refine results
  * as you type filter suggestions
* personalize results to specific needs thanks to specific sorting
* help your users build insights with instant charts
* build powerful in app features thanks to a powerful API

## Technical overview

On a technical level, you can use:
* [web components](./users/tutorial.md#building-a-search-interface) to quickly build your UI using any JavaScript framework, or plain HTML
* sensible defaults to provide a good search experience
* an easy to setup, [one stop, file configuration](./users/tutorial.md#create-a-configuration-file) to describe your content
* a [ready to deploy Docker Compose file](./users/how-to-install.md) including all needed services
* a [one command initial data import](./users/tutorial.md#import-the-data) from a JSONL data export
* [continuous update](./users/how-to-update-index.md) through a stream of events

It leverages existing components:
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) for the search engine
* [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components) (built thanks to [Lit framework](https://lit.dev/))
* [Vega](https://vega.github.io/) for the charts
* [Redis](https://redis.io/) for event stream
